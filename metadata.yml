Title: Antibiotic downselection criteria based on similarity to known antibiotics
Description: Predictive and generative efforts to discover antibiotics require post-filtering
  of compounds to ensure novelty and synthetic accessibility of the molecules. In
  a study to find de novo antibiotics against N. gonorrhoeae or S. aureus, filters
  for dissimilarity to ca. 500 known antibiotics, as well as (retro)synthetic analysis
  combined with structural filtering, was applied to downselect compounds. Here, we
  do not add the filters for activity and cytotoxicity, which were also part of the
  original study. Cytotoxicity endpoints as used in the original publication can be
  obtained from Ersilia's eos42ez.
