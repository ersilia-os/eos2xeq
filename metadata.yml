Title: Antibiotic downselection criteria based on similarity to known 
  antibiotics
Description: Predictive and generative efforts to discover antibiotics require 
  post-filtering of compounds to ensure novelty and synthetic accessibility of 
  the molecules. In a study to find de novo antibiotics against N. gonorrhoeae 
  or S. aureus, filters for dissimilarity to ca. 500 known antibiotics, as well 
  as (retro)synthetic analysis combined with structural filtering, was applied 
  to downselect compounds. Here, we do not add the filters for activity, 
  cytotoxicity, and (retro)synthetic accessibility, which were also part of the 
  original study.
